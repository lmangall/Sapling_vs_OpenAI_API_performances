This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-update.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

# Understanding the Code and Technologies

## Next.js
It's a React framework that enables server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications. It simplifies the process of building a fast and scalable web application.

## React
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you create reusable UI components.

## TypeScript
A superset of JavaScript that adds static types. TypeScript is used for writing more robust code and is compiled down to JavaScript.

## CSS
Cascading Style Sheets, used for styling web pages.

## Tailwind CSS
A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. Tailwind uses utility classes to style elements directly in your markup.

## PostCSS
A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript, used here for processing Tailwind CSS.

## API
Application Programming Interface, a way for different parts of an application to communicate with each other. In your case, you'll be interacting with the ChatGPT API.

## Component Dependencies
- **page.tsx** and **layout.tsx**: These are React components. `layout.tsx` can be used to define a common layout (header, footer, etc.) that wraps around your main page content in `page.tsx`. The `page.tsx` component depends on `layout.tsx` if you use the layout as a wrapper.
- **globals.css** and **tailwind.config.ts**: Your global styles and Tailwind configuration will determine the look and feel of your app. `globals.css` can include base styles, and Tailwind's config file lets you customize the framework's default settings.
- **next.config.mjs**: This configuration file affects the overall behavior of your Next.js application, such as redirects, rewrites, and environment variables.
- **tsconfig.json**: Affects how TypeScript is compiled in your project. It doesn't have a direct dependency on your components but ensures your TypeScript code is compiled correctly.

## Adapting for Your Goal
To create a web app that sends a user's prompt to the ChatGPT API, spell-checks the text, and displays the corrected text with changes highlighted, you'll need to focus on the following:

### Frontend:
- A form in your `page.tsx` component where users can submit their prompts.
- Displaying the corrected text with changes highlighted. This will involve state management within your React component to handle the submission and display of data.

### API Request:
- You'll need to make an API request to the ChatGPT API with the user's prompt. This can be done using JavaScript's fetch API or libraries like Axios. You might handle this in your `page.tsx` or create a separate API route in Next.js (in the `pages/api` directory) to manage the request.

### Highlighting Changes:
- To highlight changes, you'll need to compare the original text with the corrected text and use HTML and CSS to style the differences.

### Back-End (Optional):
- If you're processing the text or handling sensitive API keys, you might use Next.js API routes (`pages/api`) to keep certain logic server-side.

## Next Steps
1. **Understand Each File**: Start by familiarizing yourself with each component and configuration file. Modify simple things, like styles in `globals.css`, to see immediate effects.
2. **Learn React Basics**: Since Next.js builds on React, understanding React's core concepts (components, state, props) will be crucial.
3. **API Integration**: Practice making API requests from a React component or an API route in Next.js.
4. **Handling User Input**: Create a form in your `page.tsx` that captures user input and learns how to manage form state in React.
